This is a project I made, using entirely C++ to implement a library management system using classes, and passwords are secured using a hashing algorithm. This is a terminal based application.


The program uses three files

1. users // username, password
2. Books // bname , iban 
3. Issued books: Iban, username, Issued date, due date // both unique from the above to database. Links these two.

Here is some sample input to test it out:
Sample users:
Username: Betty
password: Riverdaleistheworstshowtoexist123

Username: Charles
password: nothingjustanInch1dent

Username: GenAlpha
password: skibbidiToiletri33

Make a new account:
Username: Carlos
password: Smoooooth0pperator

FOR ADMIN:
Username = admin
Password = admin123

Each person can only be issued 3 books max by the Admin

sample input:
Issue book: To Kill a Mockingbird
Issuer name: Charles
